This project focuses on predicting medical insurance costs using a linear regression model. To get started, make sure you have Python 3.x and pip installed. Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and install dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the main script with the following command:

```bash
python medical_insurance_prediction.py
```

You'll be prompted to choose input units (kg/m or lbs/inches), currency (INR or other), and whether to input BMI directly. Provide details for new customers, and the model will predict their insurance costs. Visualizations include count plots, bar plots, histograms, and a heatmap for better understanding. 

Dependencies:
- pandas==1.3.3
- seaborn==0.11.2
- matplotlib==3.4.3
- scikit-learn==0.24.2
